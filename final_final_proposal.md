Final final version of project proposal:

Data Source:
https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory/

The goal of this project is to track popular fan favorite pieces such as romantic era music and popular instrument solos across time as a function of historical events (not within the data set), conductors, and performers. While this may seem like a simple EDA, together with historical context such as wartime events, local unemployment, national economic health, and other major events, choice of pieces performed may be found to track as a function of these events and features. Both music and program history data will be respectively clustered by DBSCAN. Pieces will be classified by genre, composer, popularity, solos (within full orchestral pieces) and date of composition. program history will be clustered by the dataset's native features as described by the data source.

We are attempting to answer the question "What leads conductors to choose crowd pleasers over more experimental or untested pieces?"

 Data will be presented via visualizations using a historical timeline and clustering graphics. Presentation will be through interactive data (hopefully) or at least slides.

 I already have most of the data and can gather the rest on my own via wikipedia and other common resources.

 Minimal product will simply be the EDA with timeline tracking of popular music.

 Signal should reveal itself somewhat from functions but as the pieces chosen may not track closely with external historical events, composer and instances of soloist performers.


 If this does not suffice, then I'll be living the life of building a desktop/laptop recommender as previously described.
