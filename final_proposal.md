The filename for this is a bit misleading. Not making excuses for why I don't have a solid final proposal, but here's a quick summary to follow-up on previous proposals and describe a new direction I could take.

# Previous Proposals

1. Predicting successful adoption of household solar-electrification in rural off-grid regions:

  After spending 2 days trying to find labeled data for successful adoption and payment of PV systems, I finally found the primary source as I remembered it, and while the labels (successful payment as a function of time) were plotted, the featurized data was proprietary and not open/available. :((((

  Although I found lots of other interesting data across various regions, without the label for successful adoption I'll have forgo this project.  

  tl;dr Data Unavailable.

3. Scientific keywords in publications vs news as a function of time (NLP/ARIMA?):

    I haven't been able to come up with a deeper or more Data Sci involved project but *I would love to pursue this one* if I/we could come up with something novel and project-worthy. Where is the data? Web scraping off science/medicine sections of websites and top journals over the course of the last four years or so. I have not collected any such data yet as I was focusing on Proposal 1 the last few days.

    tl;dr Proposal concept needs more work. No data acquired yet.

# New Proposal

*New_Computer_Recommender* == [ ':(', ':(', ':(']:

  There are so many computers to buy which should I choose? Well this is a project for you. This project is not sad. It is a good project. We're going to featurize all the data from c-net, amazon, and consumer reports about recent laptops and desktops, and we're going to go through the boring comments sections for each computer to produce latent features such as specific uses, hipness, language of users, types of people who rated them poorly or great, because maybe that 4 star on one laptop is a better sign that you'll like it than the 5 on the macbook.

  tl;dr no data acquired. thought of this project this morning.
