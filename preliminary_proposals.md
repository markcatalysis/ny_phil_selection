## Raw Project Ideas

  1. Continuation of Myanmar Solar Electrification Study - create global tool for solar implementation generalized to all feature space known
      Much of African data (Kenya and Nigeria) was provided during previous, but we were requested to not use it to over generalize, but together with census and geographic data from other countries we may find leading features and latent features that help us determine solar power adoption success/long term viability

      Question: Can we predict where solar implementation will be successful? If so, what are the features we should be focusing on?
  2. Cat adoption rates at cat cafes vs cat features including when they're available for interaction and what other cats they're with (copycat project...)
    Gonna have to make sure I can get data from kittea cafe... Would use random forest and logistic regression methods... probably not enough data points for dbscan to reveal much but who knows!

      Question: Do cat cafes improve the rates of cat adoption? Do cat adoption rates at other agencies change in cities with cat cafes? How can we optimize cat adoption rates or improve rates of cats that are less likely to be adopted?

  3. Create a statistical tool to compare what keywords show up most in top publications (in different fields) vs what shows up in news/popular science - attempt to predict what fields are blowing up, what fields' results are lagging or underrepresented, as well as what's being altogether misrepresented

      NLP and webscraping from news websites and top scientific journals like nature, science, cell


  4. Top comment on reddit vs News events/headlines (ew)
    similar to 3. but boring and sad


## ideas i tossed out
    <!-- Poll-weighting based on social pressure and feeling of intimidation/shame
    Would money be saved if people used medical care differently? What to incentivize for insurers and patients
    Effect of solar penetration on local economy (sounds like EDA) Taxation drop?
    Ranking climate change markers for response sensitivity and mean accuracy, ARIMA?
    Energy grid usage as a function of time and energy potential to evaluate what kind of storage distribution may be necessary
      (way too vague but sounds nice.)
    Sports Hotstreaks with ARIMA are they real?
      Gotta collect that data!
    A tool for null-hypothesis testing on already published results in chemistry/materials/nano (strongly evidence based but not statistically robust papers)
    Solar availability vs return on investment - how long before ROI with/without subsidies -->
