This README will temporarily serve as a historical explanation of the steps taken in the evolution of this project.

# Initial Concept

The goal of this project is to track with time the decisions made in compositions and composers as functions of the following features: place of origin of composer, conductor, soloist instruments, and historical events that may have influenced these choices such as avoiding composers from regions at war with the US.

Currently I am using data from https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory . The basic_eda.py file represents some of the fundamental EDA an reorganization I am performing in order to shape the data into a workable dataset that can be analyzed with standard regression methods and other custom modeling tools.
